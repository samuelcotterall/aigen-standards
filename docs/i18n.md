# i18n (i18next / next-intl) — Conventions & Examples

## Conventions
1. Namespaced keys; avoid raw strings in components.
2. Generate types from messages to catch drift.
3. Keep locale in URL or headers; pre-generate dictionaries.

## Examples
```ts
// i18n/en/common.json
{ "submit": "Submit" }
```
```tsx
// component.tsx
import { useTranslations } from "next-intl";
export default function Submit() {
  const t = useTranslations("common");
  return <button>{t("submit")}</button>;
}
```
