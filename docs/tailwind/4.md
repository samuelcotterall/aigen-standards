# Tailwind CSS v4 â€” Conventions

## Conventions

- Use `@tailwind` v4 configless approach where possible.
- Rely on CSS variables and the new design tokens pipeline.
- Prefer utility-first + `cva`/`tv` for variants.

## Migration notes

- Configless setup, color tokens via CSS variables, changes in plugin API.
